Vapor Blog
This is from the tutorials from the book
from Tibor Bodecs "Server Side Swift"
it is a project that I hope to customize
and make into my own and even use as my 
future portfolio.

There will be several sections to this 
projects such as adding a database, 
a responsive frontend for the web, a client 
iOS app, then scale up to a more advanced
database, host images on AWS, and add
continuous deployment using Docker.

The project is in Vapor 4, which still 
seems fairly new. The documentation isnt 
totally clear, but I will have to research 
the documentation several times to add 
more features. I would like this to act as 
a pretty big side project along side my 
CS coursework, since I hope to be working
with many different technologies with this
project.
